List of Points for Camera stuff

Cameras must be configured correctly - see the camera class

probably preferable to calibrate both cams (to check for differences as much as anything)

at least 10 pictures must be taken, all containing the whole checkerboard

distance between camera and checkerboard should be about 1.5m, but most importantly a relativly consistent distance

multiple ANGLES should be used

for the test depth pictures syncronisation is important
